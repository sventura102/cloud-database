# Overview

Primarily, I wanted to explore more databases. I've worked with pgAdmin, MySQL, and MongoDB. I learned that this database is not much different from ones that I've worked with before but I understand that it can be very helpful to keep things all in one place if a business primarily hosts the site with Google applications, including Google Ads and even Firebase Hosting. In this project, I created a projec that pulls information from the OpenWeatherMap API, calls the data from the city name, and places it into the Firebase database.

# Cloud Database

Google Firebase
* A Weather Collection that holds City names with weather conditions

# Development Environment
Python
Google Firebase
VSCode

# Useful Websites

- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [freeCodeCamp Firebase Article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-started-with-firebase-using-python/)

# Future Work

- Display weather information on a hosting site
- Make it look presentable
- Incorporate things like adding a city, removing a city, update a city (incase it's not the correct location of a city)
